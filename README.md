# SEO-Apprentice-WoW-Optimization-Test
I separated each item category into its own file then created a program that compared power to cost as a ratio for each item. The goal was to maximize power and minimize cost while keeping the constraints in mind. 
Here are my results:
![optimal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364302e4-5b61-4f06-8686-da5c0401f028)
![power](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6d21c63-dea3-4d2a-894c-ecadc9359afd)
![cost](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e8803c-227a-4aad-b453-b9350dffaacf)
