# SEO-Apprentice-WoW-Optimization-Test
I separated each item category into its own file then created a program that generated powerful builds. The goal was to maximize power and minimize cost while keeping the constraints in mind. 
Here are my results:

I decided to choose build #8: 
Belt            : Belt of Biting Cold
Chest Armor     : Knightbane Carapace
Cloak           : Drape of the Sunreavers
Gloves          : Gloves of the Steady Hand
Helmets         : Garona's Guise
Necklace        : Pendant of Fiery Havoc
Pants           : Leggings of the Awakening
Ring 1          : Nebula Band
Ring 2          : Nebula Band
Shoes           : Icewalker Treads
Shoulder Piece  : Observer's Mantle
Wrist Guards    : Bindings of Winter Gale

Stats:
Total Power: 5104.60
Total Cost: 5600
Power/Cost Ratio: 0.91
Total Constraints: {'Stamina': 1210, 'Hit Rating': 414, 'Expertise Rating': 143}

Reasoning: it got me to over 5000 power and it costs less than 6000 gold. It had the highest power:cost ratio compared to all other builds with a total power of 5000+.
